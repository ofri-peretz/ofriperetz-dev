  title: "About Me"
  description: |
    Leading Snappy's U.S. engineering expansion. Building distributed teams, architecting revenue-generating API platforms, and establishing scalable infrastructure.

    🔥 **Currently revolutionizing the ESLint plugin ecosystem for the AI/Agentic era** — building LLM-optimized, security-first static analysis tools that empower both human developers and AI coding assistants.

    I value craftsmanship in both code and culture. Whether it's writing clean, testable code or fostering environments where diverse perspectives lead to better outcomes — I find fulfillment in the details that create lasting impact.

      questions:
        - label: What is the Interlace ESLint Ecosystem?
          content: |
            The Interlace ESLint Ecosystem is a collection of 16+ production-ready ESLint plugins designed for the AI/Agentic era. These plugins feature LLM-optimized error messages that empower both human developers and AI coding assistants to catch and fix security vulnerabilities automatically.
        - label: Why AI-native ESLint plugins?
          content: |
            Traditional ESLint error messages are designed for human developers reading them in an IDE. As AI coding assistants become more prevalent, there's a need for error messages that are also machine-parseable and provide clear remediation guidance. Our plugins bridge this gap.
        - label: Which security standards do your plugins cover?
          content: |
            Our plugins provide comprehensive coverage for OWASP Top 10 2021, OWASP Mobile 2024, and framework-specific security patterns for Express, NestJS, Lambda, and more. Each plugin includes detailed documentation with Known False Negatives disclosure.

      questions:
        - label: What is the Interlace ESLint Ecosystem?
          content: |
            The Interlace ESLint Ecosystem is a collection of 16+ production-ready ESLint plugins designed for the AI/Agentic era. These plugins feature LLM-optimized error messages that empower both human developers and AI coding assistants to catch and fix security vulnerabilities automatically.
        - label: Why AI-native ESLint plugins?
          content: |
            Traditional ESLint error messages are designed for human developers reading them in an IDE. As AI coding assistants become more prevalent, there's a need for error messages that are also machine-parseable and provide clear remediation guidance. Our plugins bridge this gap.
        - label: Which security standards do your plugins cover?
          content: |
            Our plugins provide comprehensive coverage for OWASP Top 10 2021, OWASP Mobile 2024, and framework-specific security patterns for Express, NestJS, Lambda, and more. Each plugin includes detailed documentation with Known False Negatives disclosure.

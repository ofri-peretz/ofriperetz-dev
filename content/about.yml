  Hi, I'm **Ofri Peretz**, an Engineering Leader currently leading Snappy's U.S. engineering expansion. I build distributed teams, architect revenue-generating API platforms, and establish scalable infrastructure.

  My current level of experience aligns with **[IC5/M2±](https://mui-org.notion.site/Leveling-at-MUI-5c30f9bfe65149d697f346447cef9db1)** on MUI's leveling framework — combining deep technical expertise with strategic leadership capabilities.

  ### 🔥 Current Focus: AI-Native Static Analysis

  I'm currently **revolutionizing the ESLint plugin ecosystem for the AI/Agentic era** — building LLM-optimized, security-first static analysis tools that empower both human developers and AI coding assistants.

  The **Interlace ESLint Ecosystem** includes 16+ production packages with 200+ rules covering:
  
  - 🔐 **Security**: [secure-coding](https://npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-secure-coding), [jwt](https://npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-jwt), [crypto](https://npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-crypto), [pg](https://npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-pg), [browser-security](https://npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-browser-security)
  - 🖥️ **Framework Security**: [nestjs-security](https://npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-nestjs-security), [express-security](https://npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-express-security), [lambda-security](https://npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-lambda-security), [vercel-ai-security](https://npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-vercel-ai-security)
  - ⚛️ **React**: [react-a11y](https://npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-react-a11y), [react-features](https://npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-react-features)
  - 🏗️ **Architecture & Quality**: [import-next](https://npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-import-next) (100x faster no-cycle detection), [architecture](https://npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-architecture), [quality](https://npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-quality)

  Hi, I'm **Ofri Peretz**, an Engineering Leader currently leading Snappy's U.S. engineering expansion. I build distributed teams, architect revenue-generating API platforms, and establish scalable infrastructure.

  My current level of experience aligns with **[IC5/M2±](https://mui-org.notion.site/Leveling-at-MUI-5c30f9bfe65149d697f346447cef9db1)** on MUI's leveling framework — combining deep technical expertise with strategic leadership capabilities.

  ### 🔥 Current Focus: AI-Native Static Analysis

  I'm currently **revolutionizing the ESLint plugin ecosystem for the AI/Agentic era** — building LLM-optimized, security-first static analysis tools that empower both human developers and AI coding assistants.

  The **Interlace ESLint Ecosystem** includes 16+ production packages with 200+ rules covering:
  - 🔐 **Security**: `secure-coding`, `jwt`, `crypto`, `pg`, `browser-security`
  - 🖥️ **Framework Security**: `nestjs-security`, `express-security`, `lambda-security`, `vercel-ai-security`
  - ⚛️ **React**: `react-a11y`, `react-features`
  - 🏗️ **Architecture & Quality**: `import-next` (100x faster no-cycle detection), `architecture`, `quality`

  ### 💼 Business Achievements

  - Created new high-margin revenue stream
  - Scaled APIs 100x for enterprise load

  **Infrastructure & DevEx**
  - Built Developer Experience function from scratch
  - Developed 25+ shared packages & mono-repo
  - Established company-wide API-first standards

  **Engineering Excellence**
  - Migrated to TypeScript & Jest standards
  - Increased test coverage to thousands of tests
  - Improved Web Vitals from 50s to 70s
  - Co-led Engineering Backend Guild

  ### 🛠️ Tech Stack

  **Languages**: TypeScript, JavaScript, Node.js
  **Frameworks**: React, Express, NestJS
  **Backend**: Kafka, Redis, Serverless
  **Cloud**: AWS, Docker, Kubernetes
  **DevEx**: ESLint, Nx Monorepos, CLI tools, AI/MCP integrations

  ### Beyond Code

  I value craftsmanship in both code and culture. Whether it's writing clean, testable code or fostering environments where diverse perspectives lead to better outcomes — I find fulfillment in the details that create lasting impact.
